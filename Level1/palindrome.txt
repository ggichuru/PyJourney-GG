A Palindrome is a word, a number, a phrase or a set of characters that 
read the same backwards as they do forward.

    ## ALGORITHM FOR A PALINDROME ##
a) Find if a string is a palindrome or not
    1. Check if the index first and index last letters are the same; if not same return false
    2. Repeat step 2 by increamenting the 1st index and decreamenting the last index.
    3. Repeat step 3 while first < last if(first > last) return True.


b) Find if a number is a palindrome or not.
    1. Copy the input number in another variable so that we can compare them later.
    2. Reverse the given number using this steps:
        1. Isolate the last digit of a number. The % returns the remainder of a division.
        2. Append the last digit to reverse.  reverse=(reverse*10)+lastDigit
        3. Remove last digit from number. number=number//10
        4. Iterate the process. while(number>0)
    3. Compare the reversed number with the original.
    4. If similar,then the number is a palindrome.
